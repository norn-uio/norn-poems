# NORN Poems

The corpus was developed for a literary studies project [Norwegian romantic nationalisms (NORN)](https://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/research/projects/norn-norwegian-romantic-nationalisms/index.html) and was presented at the computational humanities research (CHR) conference in Aarhus in 2024.

## Note 2025-10-06

The paper states that the corpus consists of 3440 poems from 81 books, but these numbers have been reduced due to stricter licences on the original source publications and stricter filtering criteria on the place of publication. The publications which are no longer in the public domain have been taken out, as well as publications that are Danish rather than Norwegian (with a Danish author or published in a Danish city).
