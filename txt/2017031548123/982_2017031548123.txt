Oh, what a sight, oh, what a sight! 
Let fall the sail, oh, let it fall! 
Oh, I must with the starry night 
and with this beauty fill my soul! 
I know not why, – I can't not tell; 
but I must stay; – oh dwell, oh dwell! 


The waves as music melt in beams 
of moonlight by the graceful shore; – 
I look, I listen, till it seems 
a dream to me, till never more 
I can forget, how far I be, 
the beautful image by the sea.
